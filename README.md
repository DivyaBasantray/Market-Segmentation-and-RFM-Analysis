# Customer RFM Segmentation & Value Analysis

An end-to-end customer segmentation project using Python, RFM analysis, and Power BI to understand customer behaviour, identify high-value customers, and find opportunities for customer retention and re-engagement.

---

## 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to understand customer purchasing behaviour and identify different customer groups based on their **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** behaviour.

The analysis helps answer questions such as:

- Who are the highest-value customers?
- Which customers purchase frequently?
- Which customers have not purchased recently?
- Which customers have potential for further engagement?
- How is revenue distributed across different customer segments?

The final goal is to turn transaction data into **customer-level insights that can support retention and marketing decisions**.

## 2. Key Insights

The final Power BI dashboard provided the following insights:

- The analysis covers **5,878 customers** with total customer revenue of approximately **£17.37M**.
- **Champions** include **1,297 customers** and generate approximately **£11.86M** in revenue, making them the largest value-driving segment.
- Champions have an average purchase frequency of **17.1** and average recency of around **20 days**, showing strong and recent purchasing activity.
- **At Risk** customers include **1,067 customers**, with an average recency of around **380 days** and approximately **£1.92M** in revenue.
- **Inactive / Low Value** customers account for **1,280 customers**, with an average recency of around **467 days** and average purchase frequency of only **1.2**.
- **Potential Customers** have relatively recent activity, with average recency of around **28 days**, but their average purchase frequency is only **1.5**.
- Revenue is highly concentrated among the **Champions** segment, while At Risk and Inactive customers represent opportunities for retention and re-engagement.
- The RFM analysis shows that customer groups have significantly different purchasing patterns, so the business can use targeted strategies instead of treating all customers the same.

## 3. Actionable Recommendations

Based on the RFM analysis and dashboard insights, the business can take the following actions:

### 1. Retain Champions

Champions are the most active and valuable customers and contribute a large share of total revenue.

**Recommended actions:**
- Provide loyalty rewards and exclusive offers.
- Give early access to new products or promotions.
- Use personalized product recommendations.
- Encourage repeat purchases through loyalty programs.
- Focus on retention rather than relying heavily on discounts.

### 2. Re-engage At Risk Customers

At Risk customers have previously shown purchasing activity but have not purchased recently.

**Recommended actions:**
- Run personalized re-engagement campaigns.
- Offer limited-time incentives to encourage another purchase.
- Recommend products based on previous purchases.
- Track whether customer activity improves after the campaign.

### 3. Reactivate Inactive / Low Value Customers

These customers show low recent engagement and low purchasing frequency.

**Recommended actions:**
- Use targeted win-back campaigns.
- Test different offers to identify what brings customers back.
- Prioritize previously higher-value inactive customers.
- Reduce marketing spend on customers who remain consistently unresponsive.

### 4. Develop Potential Customers

Potential Customers are relatively recent customers but have low purchase frequency.

**Recommended actions:**
- Encourage a second or repeat purchase.
- Use cross-selling and product recommendations.
- Introduce relevant bundles or personalized offers.
- Monitor whether their purchase frequency increases over time.

### 5. Strengthen Loyal Customers

Loyal Customers show consistent purchasing behaviour and can potentially become higher-value customers.

**Recommended actions:**
- Introduce loyalty programs and milestone rewards.
- Use cross-selling and upselling opportunities.
- Personalize communication based on purchase history.
- Monitor changes in recency and frequency to identify early signs of disengagement.

### 6. Use RFM Scores for Customer Prioritization

Instead of treating every customer the same, marketing efforts can be prioritized based on RFM behaviour.

For example:

- **High RFM:** Focus on retention and loyalty.
- **High Frequency but declining Recency:** Focus on re-engagement.
- **High Monetary but low Frequency:** Encourage repeat purchases.
- **Low RFM:** Use lower-cost or automated marketing campaigns.

This allows the business to allocate marketing resources based on customer behaviour and value.

## 4. Dashboard Purpose & Features

### Business Problem

A business can have thousands of customers with very different purchasing behaviours. Looking only at total sales does not show which customers are valuable, loyal, inactive or at risk of being lost.

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a clear view of **customer value, purchasing behaviour and engagement**.

### Dashboard Goal

The dashboard uses RFM segmentation to help the business:

- Identify high-value customers.
- Understand customer purchasing behaviour.
- Identify customers who may need re-engagement.
- Compare revenue contribution across customer segments.
- Understand customer recency, frequency and monetary behaviour.
- Support customer retention and marketing strategies.

### Dashboard Pages

#### Page 1: Executive Overview

Provides a high-level view of the customer base through:

- Total Customers
- Total Revenue
- Average Customer Spend
- Average Purchase Frequency
- Average Recency

- Average customer spend by segment

#### Page 2: RFM Customer Segmentation

Provides a detailed comparison of the six customer segments:

- Regular / Mid-Value
- Inactive / Low Value

The page compares customer count, revenue, recency, frequency and monetary value across segments.

#### Page 3: Customer & Revenue Insights

## 6. Dataset Origin

The dataset used in this project is **Online Retail II**, obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

The dataset contains **1,067,371 transaction records** from a UK-based non-store online retailer. The transactions cover the period from **December 2009 to December 2011** and mainly contain giftware-related purchases.

Important fields include:

- Invoice Number
- Product Code
- Quantity
- Invoice Date
- Unit Price
- Customer ID
- Country

The raw transaction data was cleaned and transformed into a customer-level RFM dataset containing **5,878 customers**, which was then used to build the Power BI dashboard.
